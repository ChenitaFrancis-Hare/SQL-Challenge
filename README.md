# SQL-Challenge


# Background

It’s been two weeks since you were hired as a new data engineer at Pewlett Hackard (a fictional company). Your first major task is to do a research project about people whom the company employed during the 1980s and 1990s. All that remains of the employee database from that period are six CSV files.


# Instructions

This Challenge is divided into three parts: data modeling, data engineering, and data analysis.


## 1. Data Modeling

Inspect the CSV files, and then sketch an Entity Relationship Diagram of the tables. To create the sketch, feel free to use a tool like QuickDBDLinks to an external site..


## 2. Data Engineering
   
2.1 - Use the provided information to create a table schema for each of the six CSV files. 

2.2 - Import each CSV file into its corresponding SQL table.


## 3. Data Analysis
   
3.1 - List the employee number, last name, first name, sex, and salary of each employee.

3.2 - List the first name, last name, and hire date for the employees who were hired in 1986.

3.3 - List the manager of each department along with their department number, department name, employee number, last name, and first name.

3.4 - List the department number for each employee along with that employee’s employee number, last name, first name, and department name.

3.5 - List first name, last name, and sex of each employee whose first name is Hercules and whose last name begins with the letter B.

3.6 - List each employee in the Sales department, including their employee number, last name, and first name.

3.7 - List each employee in the Sales and Development departments, including their employee number, last name, first name, and department name.

3.8 - List the frequency counts, in descending order, of all the employee last names (that is, how many employees share each last name).
